    <p>I am originally from a small town in North Central Florida. I worked various jobs as a teenager such as grocery store, Dairy Queen, Office Max, and Blockbuster (when those still existed). In May of 2011 I joined the US Navy.</p>
    <h2>The US Navy</h2>
    <p>I joined the USN as a Cryptologic Linguist (<i>also known as a codebreaking linguist</i>). This position was mainly focused on learning a new language, and learning how to break codes that communicators may use to try and hide information during transmission. I began working at the NSA as a Persian translator for the USN at Fort Gordon, GA. After my enlistment period with the USN of 6 years was finished I did not re-enlist. I instead became an intelligence contractor working for a department that our linguist shop had collaborated quite a lot with.</p>
    <h2>Intelligence Contractor</h2>
    <p>I worked as an Intelligence Contractor for about 4 years following my enlistment. This included a 1 year deployment to Afghanistan providing intelligence support to SOF. After I returned from deployment, I continued working at the NSA for about another year. I then made preparations to leave the intelligence field and move back home to my small home town in Florida. This would require me to begin a new career.</p>
    <h2>Starting Over</h2>
    <p>Having grown up in a small rural community, there are not many jobs nearby. As such, I focused on finding a career that I could do from home. I initially began seeking IT certifications, and was able to obtain my ITIL certification. I then began working as an at-home Apple IT Support Representative supporting I<sup>OS</sup>, iPad<sup>OS</sup>, and Watch<sup>OS</sup>. This position was far more customer service focused than I had anticipated. Rather than simply provide IT support, my days were filled with furious customers calling in because they had locked themselves out of their own accounts by forgetting their passwords, not updating their trusted phone number, no longer having access to their emails they set their accounts up with, or completely forgetting which email it even was. </p>
    <p>Telling someone they had just completely lost access to a decade's worth of family photos, baby pictures, photos of loved ones that had since passed away, business notes and contacts, etc. was a daily occurence. Telling customers there was nothing that could be done to enable them to regain access to this data, and the complete meltdown that always followed, was a daily anxiety. I decided that this form of customer service heavy IT support was not right for me, and I would need to seek other options.</p>
    <h2>Becoming a Coder</h2>
    <p>I was first exposed to coding when I was still very young. I remember learning how to use HTML to make a web page with different background colors, styles of text, music playing when you visited, etc. I would memorize entire paragraphs of code/URLs after typing them out over and over again so many times, going back trying to find the errors and having to retype them out again. I did not know how to use copy/paste, or that it even existed. I would spend hours and hours working on building pages, never considering this could be a career, or something I could learn to do in order to make money. It was just this interesting thing I found on the internet that I was compltely fascinated by at the time. I hit my teenage years, and completely forgot about coding. Never really considering it again afterwards.</p>
    <p>Now, here I am 20+ years later, and I have been reunited with coding. I could spend hours researching how to code, watching endless Youtube videos on how to learn HTML, playing around in VS Code to see how it works. It doesn't even feel like work, or an assignment. I'm genuinely interested in learning these kinds of things, and it easily holds my attention. I'm honestly pretty excited about this course, and I think I'm going to learn a lot over the next 7 months!</p>
